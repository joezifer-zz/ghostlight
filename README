ghostlight is a tiny shell script intended to deactivate DPMS for a set amount of time

How to use:

"ghostscript n" where n is the time in minutes that you want DPMS to be inactive.

Calling the script with no arguments will output either 1 or 0, depending on whether DPMS is active or not.

If you run the script in the foreground it will re-enable DPMS on SIGINT, if you run the script in the background you will have to manually re-enable DPMS with "xset dpms".
