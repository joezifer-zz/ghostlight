ghostlight is a tiny shell script intended to deactivate DPMS & the xscreensaver for a set amount of time

How to use:

"ghostscript n" where n is the time in minutes that you want DPMS & screensaver to be inactive.

Calling the script with no arguments will output values of either 1 or 0, depending on whether DPMS / xscreensaver is active or not.

If you run the script in the foreground it will re-enable the features on SIGINT, if you run the script in the background you will have to manually re-enable them with "xset dpms" / "xset s on".
